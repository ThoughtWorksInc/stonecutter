# stonecutter

[![Build Status](https://snap-ci.com/d-cent/stonecutter/branch/master/build_image)](https://snap-ci.com/d-cent/stonecutter/branch/master)

A D-CENT project: an easily deployable oauth server for small organisations.

## Development VM

You can develop and run the application in a VM to ensure that the correct versions of Stonecutter's dependencies
are installed. You will need [VirtualBox][], [Vagrant][] and [Ansible][] installed.

First, clone the repository.

Navigate to the ops/ directory of the project and run:

    vagrant up development

The first time this is run, it will provision and configure a new VM.

When the VM has started, access the virtual machine by running:

    vagrant ssh

The source folder will be located at `/var/stonecutter`.

After initial setup, navigate to the source directory with:

    cd /var/stonecutter

[Vagrant]: https://www.vagrantup.com
[Ansible]: http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html
[VirtualBox]: https://www.virtualbox.org/

### Running

To start the app, run:

    ./start_app_vm.sh

To start a web server for the application in development mode, run:

    lein ring server-headless

NB: running the application like this will save users into an in memory cache that will be destroyed as soon as the app is shutdown.

### Running test suite

To run all tests, use this command:

```
lein test
```

Commands and aliases can be found in the project.clj file. 

### Running the prototype

Simply type:

```
gulp server
```

## Adding an email provider

Stonecutter can integrate against 3rd party email providers via a shell script interface, which may optionally require
configuration via environment variables.

Scripts for individual mail service providers should be located in the ```ops/roles/mail/files/providers``` directory.
These will be copied into a deployment environment by Ansible.  Currently, an implementation has been provided for
Mailgun, which can be used as a template.

In order to select which email service is used, set the ```EMAIL_SERVICE_PROVIDER``` environment variable.  This should
match one of the provider scripts under in the ```ops/roles/mail/files/providers``` directory.  For example, to use
the Mailgun provider:

    EMAIL_SERVICE_PROVIDER=mailgun

For the mailgun example, the following environment variables are also required:

- EMAIL_DOMAIN_NAME --- the domain name that has been linked to mailgun
- MAILGUN_API_KEY --- the mailgun api username + key (i.e. a string in the form: "api:_api-key_"), provided by Mailgun.

The Continuous Delivery build and deployment architecture is documented [here] (https://docs.google.com/a/thoughtworks.com/drawings/d/1FZ35v27_pBym_NqzLbqVP_TwnHVBHNwFQss_Lzbs1bU/edit?usp=sharing).

The Hosting Architecture is documented [here] (https://docs.google.com/a/thoughtworks.com/drawings/d/1mgdxe0Q0uYZloZLFLvlwyKRx4iUangEAn4aV2qm-zWs/edit?usp=sharing).

## Deployment

### Deploying the application using docker
  
You can deploy the application using Docker. To do so, you will need three containers:
Mongo, Stonecutter and Nginx.

#### Starting a mongo container

To start a mongo container, run 

    docker run -d --name mongo mongo
    
#### Starting a Stonecutter container

To run Stonecutter you need 
 
* a clients.yml file 
* an rsa-keypair.json 
* a stonecutter.env file

To make a clients.yml file, copy the default one in this project, under Stonecutter/config. It shows the format used by the application.

To get an rsa keypair, see [below](#adding-public-private-keypair-for-openid-connect).

Store both of these two files in their own directory.

To get a stonecutter.env, copy the template that is found in the config folder.
 
Finally, run this command, replacing <config file path> with the absolute path for the directory storing your config files, and <env file path> with the path to wherever your environment variable file is stored.  

    docker run -v <config file path>:/var/config --env-file=<env file path> -v <favicon and logo absolute path directory>:/data/stonecutter/static -v <email service directory absolute path>:/var/stonecutter/email_service -p 5000:5000 --link mongo:mongo -d --name stonecutter dcent/stonecutter
    
An example script for deploying, deploy_snap.sh, is included in the ops directory.
    
    
#### Starting an Nginx container

To start an Nginx container you need 

* an SSL certificate and key
* a dhparam.pem file
* an nginx.conf file

You can acquire an SSL certificate and key online inexpensively. You should receive a pair of files, for instance stonecutter.crt and stonecutter.key. Store them in their own directory somewhere safe.

You can generate a dhparam.pem file by running: 
    
    openssl dhparam -rand â€“ 2048 > dhparam.pem
 
You can create an nginx.conf file by copying the following into a new file and replacing the <> appropriately:

    events {
    }
    http {
      server {
        listen 80;
        return 301 https://<ip address>$request_uri;
      }
      server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/<file name for SSL certificate>;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/<file name for SSL key>;
    
        ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:32m;
        ssl_session_timeout 10m;
    
        ssl_dhparam /etc/nginx/cert/dhparam.pem;
        ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.1 TLSv1;
    
        location / {
          proxy_pass http://stonecutter:5000;
          proxy_set_header Host $host;
          proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
      }
    }

Finally, run the following command:

    docker run -v <absolute path to SSL certificates and keys directory>:/etc/nginx/ssl -v <absolute path to conf file>/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf -v <absolute path to dhparam file>/dhparam.pem:/etc/nginx/cert/dhparam.pem -p 443:443 -p 80:80 --link stonecutter:stonecutter-d --name nginx-container nginx
        
### Adding public-private keypair for OpenID Connect

To generate a public-private keypair in Json Web-key (JWK) format, enter the following at the command line:

```
> lein gen-keypair <key-id>
```

where the key-id is a custom identifier for the key (for example "20150824-stonecutter").

This will generate output similar to the following:

    JWK public key for client:

The first JSON document needs to be provided to any clients wishing to use OpenID Connect when interacting with Stonecutter, while the second should be stored in a file --- for example "rsa-keypair.json" --- which should be kept secure.

To deploy Stonecutter with this key, the rsa-keypair.json file needs to be placed in a directory accessible by the deployed instance, and the Stonecutter instance should be started with the environment variable ```RSA_KEYPAIR_FILE_PATH``` pointing to its location.

If deploying using the Snap CI tool (https://snap-ci.com/), this process is automated by including the rsa-keypair.json file in the secure files for the snap stage responsible for deployment, with the filename "rsa-keypair_<SNAP_STAGE_NAME>.json".  The ```ops/deploy_snap.sh``` script will then manage copying the file to the appropriate location on the target, and starting the app with the environment variable set.
